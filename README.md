# AdNauseam-Ware
This program will maliciously do recursive copies of itself. I recommend not running this beyond the first few versions.

This program's function is to emulate early malicious programs by copying itself toe fill filespace.
I do not wish to do this optimally, nor in a way that causes even moderate harm.
I am trying to program it in a fashion which teaches me useful skills.
This means a rube-goldberguesque contraption of barely reasonable scripts.

I think it looks fun so far.


AdNauseam-Ware:
Demo that creates a single copy of itself.
v2AdNauseam-Ware:
Creates copies ad nauseam, until program is halted through commands.

future steps:
Make the copies executed on creation.
Make an AntiNauseam program that deletes copies as they are made.

Editor's Note. This WAS fun.
