# AdNauseam-Ware
This program will do recursive copies of itself. I recommend not running this beyond the first few versions. Do not use this to cause damage to systems.
It is unlikely this program can be converted into a malicious and intentionally harmful one, but I recommend against it.

This program's function is to emulate early malicious programs by copying itself toe fill filespace.
I do not wish to do this optimally, nor in a way that causes even minor harm.
I am trying to program it in a fashion which teaches me useful skills.
This means a rube-goldberguesque contraption of barely reasonable scripts.

I think it looks fun so far. Do not use this beyond a controlled environment.


AdNauseam-Ware:
Demo that creates a single copy of itself.
v2AdNauseam-Ware:
Creates copies ad nauseam, until program is halted through commands. Please understand you will need to know how to manually halt the execution of this script.
Please run only in debug mode in your code-editor to make this easier.

future steps:
Make the copies executed on creation.
Make an AntiNauseam program that deletes copies as they are made.

Editor's Note. This WAS fun.
